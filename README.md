# My AOC 2025 Solutions

Most of these solutions are very efficient. 

I've been trying to do them with zero dependencies and without looking things up, which has led to some difficulties in later days...

Day 9 part 2 takes about 4 mins on my laptop.

For day 10 part 2 I'm pretty sure the solution is to do simplex with branch and bound or something like that but I don't wanna add dependencies and don't really have time to write that all myself, so I gave up after realising my lazy Dijkstra attempt was way too slow.
